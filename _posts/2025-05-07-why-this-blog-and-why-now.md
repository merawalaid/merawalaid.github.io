## Why yet another blog and why now?


I believe that many of us face a critical challenge in the future: how to carve out our unique voice and establish a lasting impact on our community. Even today most narratives and ‘trends’ we see are being shaped by the currents and campaigns of social media and the rules and constraints of content  platforms. 

For leaders and technology professionals for today, we have an open challenge, to reclaim ownership of our own content and, crucially, our own story.

When I compare where we stand today in terms of personal content ownership to how we operated the age ‘home-pages on geocities’  in the late 1990s, I see a worrying difference. 
The once open frontier of online discourse is increasingly governed by algorithmic gatekeepers and the inherent limitations of social media platforms. For the aspirational independent thought leaders and the quirky technology professionals there are risks of being drowned out in the noise without a dedicated space to cultivate and control their message.

This isn't just about vanity; it's about strategic necessity. In a future dominated by influencers and curated content, the ability to articulate your expertise, share hard-earned insights, and shape perceptions hinges on owning your digital presence. Beyond the constraints and potential biases of third-party platforms lies the need of unfettered creative expression and the establishment of your personal "source of truth.” for your own narrative.

Therefore, even for someone like myself, a long-time observer rather than a vocal participant in the online arena, the time has come to stake a claim. This website represents a deliberate act: a place of my own to hang my hat online. I strongly encourage you to do so yourself.

If you are a little technically inclined, I would recommend hosting your own content instead of relying on platforms like Blogger, Wordpress, or Medium. 
The barrier of entry is virtually non-existant. For example this site, using github pages took zero investment and a grand total of 5 minutes to setup. *Thanks to guides like [how-to-build-a-sql-blog](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html)*
