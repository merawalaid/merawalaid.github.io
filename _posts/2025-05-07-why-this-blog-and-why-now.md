# Why yet another blog now?


I believe that many of us face a growing challenge : how to carve out the space for our unique voice in future and make a lasting impact on our community. Even today, most narratives and ‘trends’ we see are being shaped by the currents and campaigns of social media and the rules and constraints of content  platforms. 

For leaders and technology professionals of today, we have an open challenge, to reclaim ownership of our own content and, crucially, our own story.

When I compare where we stand today in terms of personal content ownership to how we operated in the age ‘home-pages on geocities’ in the late 1990s, I see a worrying difference. 
The once open frontier of online discourse is increasingly governed by algorithmic gatekeepers and the inherent limitations of social media platforms. For the aspirational independent thought leaders and the quirky technology professionals there are risks of being drowned out in this noise without a dedicated space to cultivate and control their message.

This isn't  about vanity or self-promotion; it's about strategic necessity. In a future dominated by influencers and curated content, the ability to articulate your expertise, share hard-earned insights, and shape perceptions hinges on owning your digital presence. Beyond the constraints and potential biases of third-party platforms lies the need of unfettered creative expression and the establishment of your personal "source of truth.” for your own narrative.

Therefore, even for someone like myself, a long-time observer rather than a vocal participant in the online arena, the time has come to stake a claim. This website represents a deliberate act: a place of my own to hang my hat online. I strongly encourage you to do so yourself.

### Owning Your Digital Voice
If you are technically inclined, I would recommend hosting your own content instead of relying on platforms like [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/), [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), or [Medium](). Those are great too, but if you are intrested in full ownership of your content, without the frills, the barrier for entry is virtually non-existant. *(Thanks to guides like [how-to-build-a-sql-blog](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html))*. For example this site, using github pages, took zero investment and a grand total of 4 minutes to setup. 

So those are my reasons, I am sure many of us will have different ones, but the common theme of ownership, agency and flexibility is likely to run through most of them.
